What is bundle?
A Web Essentials bundle file is a recipe for grouping, and usually compressing, a set of files of the same type to limit the number and 
the amout the data to be downloaded by the browser.

Web Essentials offers two bundling types:
----------------------------------------
.bundle : for CSS and JS files
For CSS, it outputs a XML bundle recipe file, a destination CSS file and a minified version of source if you turn on the minify 
option on the recipe.
For JavaScript files, it outputs a destination JS file, a minified version of sources and a source-map of that min.

.sprite : for images (PNG, JPG and GIF). It generates a sprite image, CSS with example code for all the possible coordinates 
in background property, LESS and SASS files with mixins holding the same background properties and a custom map file (JSON) with all those coordinates.

Tools for bundling assets come in a variety of shapes and sizes:
